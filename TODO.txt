ASAP:
too but white space for nav links and name/title needs to move up a bit

profile image needs to go above text on mobile
profile img a bit smaller => it is being cut off on right
profile text is not centered => also cut off on right
the line under projects and line above footer are messed up on mobile => significantly reduce the y axis margin
web and repo buttons for each project is cut off
each project => remove some of the padding/margin between content and blue box


Later:
go back and have text fly in and bounce in effects
add/fix border shaddow in css
