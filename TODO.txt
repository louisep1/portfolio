bio section on large screens has too much width => add some padding/margin to left and right
(my screen is 1280x854 ? => so maybe add for sized bigger than this)

maybe make box shadow around whole of project ??

do lighthouse inspects for both desktop and mobile

(does projects section need more space at top and bottom ?)

maybe project icons too big on mobile (530) ????

Later:
go back and have text fly in and bounce in effects
